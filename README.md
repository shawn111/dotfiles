# dotfiles with notes

Rust related toolsets are so powerful, such as fish / zelllij / helix / wezterm.
However, switch from orignal work flows to setup lots of machines are quite painful.

Likely, I found rotz to maintain my dotfiles.
Then I realized it is supur match with all drop-in sytles files.
I'm planning not just keep config file but also documents about howto use them.
